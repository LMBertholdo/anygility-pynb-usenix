Here you can find some python Notebooks used for data analysis on paper [Anycast Agility: Network Playbooks to Fight DDoS](https://ant.isi.edu/bib/Rizvi22a.html).

We have the following notebooks:

- [ddos-poison-fig14](https://github.com/LMBertholdo/anygility-pynb-usenix/blob/main/ddos-poison-fig14/graph-poison-path.ipynb): Analysis of poison experiments
- [playbook_analysis](https://github.com/LMBertholdo/anygility-pynb-usenix/blob/main/playbook_analysis/Playbook-Analysis-Tangled-Catchment-load-distribution.ipynb): Basic building of a playbook from stats and analysis.
- [tangled-catchment-distribution-fig6](https://github.com/LMBertholdo/anygility-pynb-usenix/blob/main/tangled-catchment-distribution-fig6/Tangled-Catchment-load-distribution-usenix-fig6.ipynb): Catchment distribution analysis
- [tangled-catchment-prepend](https://github.com/LMBertholdo/anygility-pynb-usenix/blob/main/tangled-catchment-prepend/Tangled-Catchment-load-distribution.ipynb): Analysis of path prepend impact on the Tangled testbed
- [Anygility-Tangled-Catchment-load-distribution](https://github.com/LMBertholdo/anygility-pynb-usenix/blob/main/tangled-catchment-distribution-fig6/Anygility-Tangled-Catchment-load-distribution.ipynb): Catchment distribution analysis (for diferent dataset versions - keeping compatible)

Each notebook have a dataset on directory as example. Those notebooks were used to create paper figures as indicated (fig6,fig14).

More information and datasets can be found at [Datasets About Anycast Agility Against DDoS in Tangled Testbed](https://ant.isi.edu/datasets/anycast/anycast_against_ddos/tangled/index.html)
